## Getting Started

Axer is a Kotlin Multiplatform debugging library that provides HTTP request monitoring, logging, exception handling, and Room database inspection for Android, iOS, and JVM platforms.

### What You Can Contribute

- **Bug fixes**: Help us identify and fix issues
- **New features**: Propose and implement new debugging capabilities
- **Documentation**: Improve docs, add examples, or fix typos
- **Platform support**: Extend compatibility to new platforms
- **Performance improvements**: Optimize existing functionality
- **Tests**: Add or improve test coverage

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- **JDK 17 or higher** (JDK 21 recommended for best compatibility)
- **Android SDK** (for Android targets)
- **Xcode** (for iOS targets, macOS only)
- **Git** for version control

### Recommended Tools

- **IntelliJ IDEA** or **Android Studio** (latest stable version)
- **Kotlin Multiplatform Plugin** (usually bundled)

### Platform-Specific Requirements

- **Android**: Android SDK with API level 21+ (minSdk = 21)
- **iOS**: Xcode with iOS deployment target as specified in project
- **JVM**: Compatible JDK installation

## Fork and Clone

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub by clicking the "Fork" button
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/axer.git
   cd axer
   ```
3. **Add the upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/orioneee/axer.git
   ```
4. **Verify your setup**:
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   # Should show both origin (your fork) and upstream (original repo)
   ```

## Code Style and Guidelines

### Kotlin Style

- Follow **Kotlin Coding Conventions** (Official Style Guide)
- Use `kotlin.code.style=official` (already configured in `gradle.properties`)
- Prefer explicit type declarations for public APIs
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add KDoc comments for public APIs

### Code Organization

- **Package structure**: Follow existing `io.github.orioneee.*` package naming
- **Internal APIs**: Use `internal` visibility for implementation details
- **File naming**: Use PascalCase for class files, follow Kotlin conventions

### Best Practices

- **Multiplatform compatibility**: Ensure code works across all supported platforms
- **Resource management**: Properly close resources and handle lifecycles
- **Error handling**: Use appropriate exception handling and logging
- **Performance**: Consider memory usage and processing efficiency
- **Testing**: Write unit tests for new functionality

## Building and Testing

### Building Sample Applications Android

```bash
# Android sample
./gradlew :sample:composeApp:assembleDebug

# Desktop remote debugger
./gradlew :axer-remote-debugger:createDistributable
```

## Task Automation

Axer provides convenient Gradle tasks for common development workflows. These tasks help you run, build, and test modules quickly, making development smoother.

### Common Tasks

- **Run the sample Compose app**:
  ```bash
  ./gradlew :sample:composeApp:run
  ```

- **Run the Axer Remote Debugger**:
  ```bash
  ./gradlew :axer-remote-debugger:run
  ```

- **Build and test all modules**:
  ```bash
  ./gradlew build
  ```

Feel free to use these tasks for local development, debugging, and testing. If you add new modules or sample apps, consider documenting any custom tasks you create in this file.

## Making Changes

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names with the following patterns (these are guidelines, not strict rulesâ€”choose what fits your workflow):

- `feature/description` - New features
- `bugfix/description` - Bug fixes
- `docs/description` - Documentation changes
- `refactor/description` - Code refactoring
- `test/description` - Test additions/improvements

Examples:
- `feature/okhttp-timeout-support`
- `bugfix/memory-leak-ktor-interceptor`
- `docs/installation-guide-update`

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or fixing tests
- `chore`: Build system or auxiliary tool changes

**Examples:**
```
feat(okhttp): add request timeout configuration support

fix(ktor): resolve memory leak in request interceptor

docs(readme): update installation instructions for v1.2.0
```

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

Try to:
- Update documentation if needed
- Add tests for new functionality (optionally)
- Verify multiplatform compatibility
- Check that no existing functionality is broken

### Submitting a Pull Request
